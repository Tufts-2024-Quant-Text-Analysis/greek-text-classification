    "Text classification is a process in Machine Learning that categorizes text into a certain category. We've seen a version of text classification before, when we looked at Greek dramas in Week 6 and used TF-IDF data to assign text to a dramatist. Sentiment Analysis, which was part of our journal club, is also a form of text classification.\n",
